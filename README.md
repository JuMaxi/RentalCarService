# Rental Car Service

**Attention: This is a work in progress.**


### Synthesis:
In this project, I will be working with End Points, Interfaces, Unit Tests, SQL, etc. 
My purpose is to create classes for categories of cars, places where you can take and return the car, and times to return it, brands, countries, users, and values.  Also, classes with functions to insert the cars, register users, booking. 
The data are going to save in the DataBase SQL. 
Briefly, the objective is to develop a complete rental car service with all the functionalities necessary to work that appropriately. 
Lastly, it will make the unit test secure all the previous steps are functional.
